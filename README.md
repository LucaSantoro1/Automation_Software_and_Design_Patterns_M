B&amp;R Projects:
1) **CUTTER - CONVEYOR EXERCISE 1** : the object of the first motion exercise is to to program a PLC such that: when a sensor detect a product that is travelling on a conveyor belt, the conveyor performs an additional motion in order to place the product under the cutter and then the cutter performs its motion. At the end the conveyor can restart again and wait for the next product.![image](https://github.com/LucaSantoro1/Automation_Software_and_Design_Patterns_M/assets/113595229/09f41ef7-3536-41ee-adec-97c48bf6cac2)
2) **CUTTER - CONVEYOR EXERCISE 2** : , the object is to synchronize the motion of the cutter with the motion of the conveyor belt (by design a proper cam profile): so the product must be cut without decreasing the conveyor beltâ€™s speed. ![image](https://github.com/LucaSantoro1/Automation_Software_and_Design_Patterns_M/assets/113595229/26ac71a0-72db-42ed-b016-b7b98863f2ba)
